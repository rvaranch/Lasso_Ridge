## General Information
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. 
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. I have build a regression model using regularisation(Ridge & Lasso) in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
The company wants to know:
  1. Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
  2. How well those variables describe the price of a house.

## Conclusions
- Developed the Models using Ridge and Lasso.
- We have found best alpha for Lasso, Ridge. 
- Identified the top 5 variables which are impacting the price of the house. 
- Concluded that Lasso Regression in better than Ridge for this project.
